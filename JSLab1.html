It <span id = "adverb1">___</span>  occurred to them to return the money. Both were about to go on a huge <span id = "verb1">____</span> spree. However, it wasn't until the news spoke out about a pot of cash being missing and <span id ="verb2">___</span> anyone who may have any information to come forward. Finally, Dave <span id ="verb3">___</span> up from his dream and everything was fiction.
